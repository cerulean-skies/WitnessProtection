# WitnessProtection

This is a  Whaleshares Witness Failover Tool, written in NodeJS and based off of the original design by the Witness @kennybll, he is a solid guy,
and did excellent work in that project which you can find HERE, though I have added a few features to this version to make it more
'User-Friendly'. For starters, I have involved a visual GUI component to the server, which can be viewed by visiting the URL 127.0.0.1:3000, which is the address for your local host. The GUI will make storing, and maintaining data much simpler, as well as simplifying the run process. This tool was designed to be used in our home PC's, though I know there are people who will want to run this on their witness server, so I will be including a headless configuration as soon as possible.

### Version
0.8

WitnessProtection requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.
